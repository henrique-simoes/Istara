## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-30 Stabilization Sweep

The detailed scratch audit note has been retired. Durable stabilization context
now lives in `Tech.md`, `TESTING.md`, `testing/TEST_HISTORY.md`, and Compass
Forge evidence.

### Added
- **Team RBAC Permission Contract**: Added central permission behavior documenting global admin, project admin, researcher, viewer, `404` concealment, and `403` forbidden-operation semantics.
- **Compass Forge Planning Evidence**: Future plans, deferred hardening, and feature candidates now live in Compass Forge specs/tasks/evidence or domain strategy docs instead of root scratch ledgers.
- **Admin Dashboard Foundation**: Added admin-only `/api/admin/*` aggregation endpoints and an admin-only dashboard for global users, project, access, compute, usage, and connection-string visibility.
- **System-Wide RBAC Hardening Pass**: Extended central project/admin authorization checks across Files, Memory, Context DAG, Metrics, UX Laws compliance, Reports, Code Applications, Codebook Versions, Deployments, MCP clients, Agents, Context hierarchy, Channels, Surveys, Loops, Autoresearch, Notifications, Backup, Scheduler, and Audit routes.
- **Final Authorization Inventory Pass**: Closed remaining security/product edges in compute pool readouts, legacy voice-transcribe, presentation slide instructions, steering queues, Meta-Hyperagent, Interfaces screens/Figma/handoff/mock endpoints, and settings telemetry/self-healing exports.
- **Split Connection String Types**: User invite strings and compute donation strings now use explicit token kinds. User invites no longer carry relay/network credentials; compute donation strings cannot create user accounts.
- **Piper / Design Lead**: Added `design-lead` as a first-class system agent role and documented Piper as the Istara Interface Agent.
- **Persona Integrity Tests**: Added coverage that hardcoded system agents have complete persona file sets and that incomplete runtime personas are repaired.
- **Meta-Agent Observation Persistence**: Recent observations now persist and are returned with status so proposal state can be explained after restarts.
- **Autoresearch Operational Metrics**: Exposed and displayed task-review, compute, telemetry, agent, pipeline, and collection metrics in Autoresearch.
- **Design Chat Session Continuity**: Interfaces Design Chat now tracks design session ids and preserves model responses across view changes.
- **Readable Generated Artifacts**: Skill-generated JSON artifacts now produce researcher-readable Markdown Documents while retaining structured content for agent/RAG use.

### Changed
- **Project Access Enforcement**: Project listing/detail now scopes by team membership: global admins see all projects, while non-admin users see only invited projects.
- **Viewer Read-Only Enforcement**: Viewers can read visible project state across Chat, Interfaces Design Chat, Tasks, Documents, Findings, and Codebooks but cannot send messages, create sessions, upload through Chat, execute skills, or mutate project data.
- **Project Role Awareness**: Project API responses now include the current user's project role so the frontend can distinguish invited project viewers, researchers, and project admins instead of relying only on global account role.
- **Operational Admin Console**: Admin Dashboard now includes inline global role changes, project access grants/role changes, project delete control, user invite generation, and compute donation string generation.
- **Live Status Labeling**: Reworded the bottom-left status from vague "Realtime" language to "Live updates" and clarified that it refers to the `/ws` live-events socket, not backend or LLM health.
- **Documents as Tag Source of Truth**: Documents now aggregate tags from document metadata, nuggets, and code applications so Interview/agent-created tags surface consistently.
- **Codebook Fallbacks**: Findings Codebook can fall back to legacy codebooks and derive codebook content from nuggets/code applications when no explicit version exists.
- **Task Review Drag Semantics**: Kanban drag behavior now preserves review requirements: Done is human-approved and backward movement requires Request Revision messaging.
- **UX Laws Compliance Semantics**: UX Laws views distinguish "not evaluated" from true 100% compliance when no `ux-law:` evidence exists.
- **MCP Server/Policy UX**: MCP server enable/disable language and access policy payload handling were clarified; grouped frontend payloads normalize into backend `allow_*` fields.
- **Self-Evolution Verification**: Skill proposal promotion now surfaces verification state and blocks approval when verification fails.
- **Interfaces Markdown Rendering**: Design Chat assistant output and streaming text render Markdown/GFM like the main Chat menu.
- **Generated Document Preview**: Markdown-like Documents now render as formatted Markdown instead of monospaced raw text in the Documents preview.

### Fixed
- **Onboarding File Step**: "Add research files" now routes to Documents upload instead of remaining in Settings.
- **Document Preview Reliability**: Text-like document preview path/content handling was tightened.
- **Evidence Chain Empty States**: Recommendation drilldowns no longer imply a raw quote/observation exists when no supporting chain is linked.
- **Meta-Agent Layout**: Pending proposal confidence bars are clamped to prevent layout overflow.
- **WebSocket Recovery**: Live updates retry after stale/missing auth token states and reconnect when authentication changes.
- **Network Discovery Validation**: Network LLM discovery ignores hosts that do not advertise real provider-shaped model ids/names.

### Reverted
- **Silent LLM Alias Deduplication**: Removed the attempted identical-catalog duplicate collapse for network LLM servers because two legitimate machines can expose the same provider, port, subnet, and model list. Future handling must use stronger host identity evidence or explicit admin review.

## [2026.04.27] — Voice Transcription & Security Hardening

### Added
- **Voice Transcription Pipeline**: Fully asynchronous background processing for audio uploads.
- **Whisper Model Caching**: Improved performance with lazy loading and caching of primary (base) and ICR (tiny) Whisper models.
- **Embedded Audio Player**: Native players in Documents and Interviews views for direct media playback.
- **Transcription Previews**: Mono-spaced, high-readability transcription previews with auto-tagging.
- **2FA (TOTP)**: Support for authenticator-based two-factor authentication for team accounts.
- **Passkey Integration**: Support for biometric/device-based login via WebAuthn API.
- **Security Onboarding**: Mandatory recovery code generation and optional passkey setup during first team login.
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, and Referrer-Policy protection on all API responses.
- **Compass Planner Governance**: `planner.md` is now tracked as part of Compass, covering multi-agent planning, repository intelligence checks, correction/re-review loops, protected Compass files, and final user handoff reports.

### Fixed
- **Transcription Stability**: Resolved race conditions in Whisper model loading and fixed ICR consensus logic.
- **Test Integrity**: Standardized transcription unit tests to use reliable mocking and temporary file paths.
- **Gemma4 Compatibility**: Improved release packaging and Apple Metal (MPS) trainer stability.
- **ESLint Migration**: Modernized frontend linting configuration with `eslint.config.mjs`.

### Changed
- **File Processor**: Enhanced `process_audio` with content-aware chunking for interview turn detection.
- **Login Experience**: Redesigned login screen with support for 2FA flows and recovery code entry.
- **Mainline Integration State**: Dataset generation, passkey security hardening, skill registry cleanup, compute connection lifecycle hardening, integration retry semantics, Compass swarm process updates, and real-time voice recording have been integrated into `main`.
- **Branch Hygiene (2026-04-28)**: Canonical list of deprecated/stale branches added to `planner.md`. Legacy branches (`feat/voice-transcription`, `review/p*`, `fix-ci-validation`, etc.) are 46–124 commits behind `main` and must not be merged wholesale.

---

## [2026.04.20.2] — Phase Zeta & Compute Pool Overhaul

### Added
- **Layer 5 Orchestration Benchmarks**: Real-world integration benchmarking against live LLM servers (LM Studio/Ollama) with 100% Tool Selection Quality (TSQ) and true DAG decomposition.
- **Connection String Lifecycle Management**: Admins can now generate, list, and revoke connection strings for team members and compute donation, complete with a new Settings UI (`ConnectionStringPanel.tsx`).
- **Backup Restoration UI**: Full pipeline for re-importing system backups via the UI, including atomic directory replacement and automated server restart.
- **Consulting-Grade Reporting Engine**: Upgraded MECE reporting to use the Minto Pyramid Principle and SCR (Situation-Complication-Resolution) framework.
- **Instructions to Create Slides**: New Presentation API and UI feature that translates deep research reports into "Ghost Deck" structures for external AIs.

### Changed
- **ComputeRegistry Unification**: Centralized all LLM routing. Replaced brittle heuristics with a **BFCL-pattern dynamic probe** to actively verify `tool_calls` support.
- **RFC 3986 URL Normalization**: Enforced trailing-slash normalization in `ComputeRegistry` to eliminate 404 errors on generic OpenAI-compatible providers.
- **Five-Layer Testing Architecture**: Expanded from three layers to explicitly include Orchestration Benchmarks (Layer 4) and Real-World Integration (Layer 5).
- **Dynamic Documentation Scripts**: `check_integrity.py` and `update_agent_md.py` are now dynamically self-maintaining, automatically discovering new test layers and wrapper docs.

### Fixed
- **RBAC Security Reinforcements**: Restricted project deletion to admins only; allowed non-admins to contribute local compute power.
- **Team Transparency**: Authenticated researchers can now view the team member list.
- **Update Process Reliability**: Hardened the auto-update script to use `git stash` instead of destructive resets.
- **Uninstall Script Completeness**: Ensured complete purge of macOS app bundles, Linux desktop entries, and Tauri local data.
